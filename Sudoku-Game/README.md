I was looking for ideas to add to my developer portfolio and as i was searching i found this one.
It almost instantly grabbed my attention because i used to play sudoku pretty often when i was a kid.

It is so interesting to go through the code and just see how it works.
I explained everything as comments in the code so it is very easy to read.
