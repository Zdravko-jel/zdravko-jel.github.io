# Space Jets Game

It was very fun to make and implement most of the algorithms in the game.
It is based almost fully on working with timers.
I created it using Forms in Visual Studio.

I commented every functionality so that it is easy to understand what they are doing.
Hope you enjoy it as much as i did making it!
